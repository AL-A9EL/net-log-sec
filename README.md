# NetLogSec 🛡️

**NetLogSec** is a modular Python-based network security and log analysis utility designed to parse security logs, detect brute-force attacks using rolling time windows, and generate detailed threat reports. 

Developed as a cybersecurity capstone project, it demonstrates clean architecture, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data manipulation with Pandas, and robust error handling.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Log Parsing & Regex:** Extracts timestamps, IP addresses, statuses, and usernames from raw log data.
* **Time-Window Brute-Force Detection:** Detects rapid consecutive failed login attempts within a specific rolling time window (e.g., 5 minutes).
* **Severity Scoring:** Automatically categorizes security alerts into `Medium` or `High` threat levels.
* **Input Validation:** Securely validates IPv4 and IPv6 addresses using Python's standard `ipaddress` library.
* **Automated Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests implemented using `pytest`.

💻 Usage
Run the interactive Command Line Interface (CLI):

Bash
python -m src.main
CLI Menu Options:
Load and Parse Log File: Enter the path to your log file (e.g., data/sample_auth.log).

Detect Brute Force Attacks: Set your preferred time window (minutes) and failed attempts threshold to scan for threats.

Export Comprehensive Report: Save parsed logs into a structured CSV report.

Exit: Safely close the utility.
